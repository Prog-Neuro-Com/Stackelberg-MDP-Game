# Stackelberg MDP Forest Collection Game

A research project investigating Stackelberg equilibria in MDP games, specifically studying whether the Efficient Payoff Frontier (EPF) becomes convex in infinitely repeated games.

## Game Scenario

**Setting**: Two players collect resources in a forest grid
- **Leader**: Wants to maximize wood collection
- **Follower**: Wants to maximize fruit collection  
- **Constraint**: Limited steps for both players
- **Stackelberg Element**: Leader announces strategy first, including punishment threats

**Key Research Question**: Does the EPF approach convexity as the game is repeated infinitely?
